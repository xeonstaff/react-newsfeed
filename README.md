## Idea
Project design based on the 'tours' project by John Smilga via freeCodeCamp.org. The CSS was straight-up stolen and modified slightly. 


## Data
Uses data & images from this API:
https://gnews.io/

## Tools
components - material UI

## Future Directions
If I were to spend anymore time on this app, I'd:
i. add Twitter trending topics to sort by
ii. graph some information/data to create a more unique project

## Hire me
I'm really just tryna get hired. Hit me up:
